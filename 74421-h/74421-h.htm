<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE Authors, who welcome
this opportunity of addressing
their readers
through the conventional
channel of a preface,
have not written without
an object. That object
has not been to teach
the art of football, which art can only be attained
by practice. It has been to collect the scattered
and fragmentary knowledge which surrounds the
history of an ancient pastime. In the pursuit of
this object they have performed the pleasant duty
of exploring many literary storehouses, and have
not seldom been compelled to wander far out of
the beaten track. They will have attained their
object if they can pass on to their readers one-tenth
of the delight which resulted to themselves
from their wanderings. There also resulted a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
theory, which was not adopted without anxious
argument, that the games of football now in vogue
owe their origin almost entirely to the public
schools; and that in the public schools rules were
the consequence of circumstances and environment.
At the same time football has a history
which has been faithfully followed.</p>

<p>In addition to the thanks, which we cannot
adequately express, to ancient authors, we owe a
debt of gratitude to Walter Rye, Esq., than whom
none is better versed in the antiquities of sport,
for valuable advice as to sources of information.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>HEN a national taste or a
national trait is under consideration,
sound criticism
often falls from a foreign
observer. At the present
day an American novelist,
whose subtle analysis of
character is charming English
readers, has pronounced his opinion that an
Englishman is only to be understood and appreciated
when he is seen out of doors in a flannel
suit; while a French critic goes further, and assigns
a narrower sphere to British ability, by making
the observation that an Englishman is only perfectly
happy when he has a ball to play with.
Certain it is, that, good as they are in any branch
of sport, it is in games in which a ball of any
kind is used that the members of the English race
are the most enthusiastic and proficient players.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
There is another feature, too, in such games which
renders them peculiarly interesting; they have all
an ancient and an honourable history. So far
back indeed does the history of the different
kinds of ball-play reach, that the investigation of
their origin, and for the present in particular of
the earliest records of the game of football, can
hardly fail to produce interesting fruit.</p>

<p>The most learned historian of sports and
pastimes, Joseph Strutt, indulges in an elaborate
antiquarian inquiry into the origin of the ball,
having recourse to the most ancient of the classics
for his authorities. Hand-ball, he says, is, “if
Homer may be accredited, coeval at least with the
destruction of Troy. Herodotus attributes the
invention of the ball to the Lydians; succeeding
writers have affirmed that a female of distinction
named Anagalla, a native of Corcyra, was the first
who made a ball for the purposes of pastime,
which she presented to Nausica (<i>sic</i>), the daughter
of Alcinous, King of Phæacia, and at the same
time taught her how to use it.” To emphasize
his authority, the antiquary quotes three lines
from Pope’s Odyssey (bk. v.).</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“O’er the green mead the sporting virgins play,</div>
<div class="verse">Their shining veils unbound, along the skies,</div>
<div class="verse">Tost and retost, the ball incessant flies.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>The same author is much, and it would seem
somewhat unnecessarily, distressed at the fact that
the writer of a 14th century manuscript preserved
in Trinity College, Oxford, and the Venerable
Bede are not in harmony as to the early capacities
of the athletic saint, Cuthbert. The former says
of him that “he pleyde atte balle with the children
that his fellowes were,” while the latter merely
makes mention of his general excellence at games
involving great muscular exertion. The plain
fact of the matter is, that the origin of the ball
is one of those matters which must of necessity
be lost in antiquity. Nature herself supplies an
endless variety of balls of all sizes, suitable for
throwing from hand to hand, and the act of playing
with them is instinctive. The apple and the
orange are, so to speak, objects which nature
supplies, not only as objects of food, but also as
materials for pastime; clay, too, and snow, are of
so plastic a nature that the hands even of children
naturally mould them into a spherical form and
hurl them to and fro in sport.</p>

<p>Before, however, an attempt be made to show
how the game of football became developed as a
specific sport, it is without doubt the duty of sober
historians first to chronicle the legends which have
attached themselves to the foundation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
game. Firstly, it is said that in ancient times it
was the custom to kick a large stone from parish
to parish, both in Scotland and in England, for
the purpose of marking boundaries and asserting
rights of way; and that in this practice, which was
indulged in by large bodies of the parishioners,
each of whom desired to give his kick when he
got the opportunity, we are to find the origin of
football. Certain it is, at any rate, that the practice
of kicking a leather football over a path on Whit-Monday,
for the purpose of exercising a right of
way, endured into the present century in the Isle
of Purbeck in Dorsetshire, a ball being annually
presented to the workmen of certain quarries for
that purpose. But the origin of the practice, both
in that locality and in some other parts of the
country where it is known to have been followed,
is shrouded in antiquity; and there is little evidence
to show that this practice caused the rise of
football, instead of having arisen at a time when
the game itself was well known. This latter view
seems the most probable. The second legend of
the origin of the game is one of a gruesome
character, and far more suitable to be chronicled
in connection with the legendary or mythical stage
of history. The ancient Teutons, it is averred,
did not scalp the bodies of their slaughtered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
enemies (as did the Choctaws), nor did they mutilate
them (as do the Bashi-bazouks), but in grim
sport cut off their heads and kicked them about,
after the fashion of the Baron in the Ingoldsby
legend of Sheppey, who, after he had donned the
famous boots, first killed the holy father with a
magnificent “punt,” and afterwards encompassed
his own ruin by an ill-timed “place-kick” at the
skull of Grey Dolphin. But even granting that
our savage progenitors indulged in the amiable
pastime which we have described (and after all
it is far from improbable), we can still comfort
ourselves by feeling certain that football had no
such horrible origin; for the game of head-kicking
may have been magnificent—may have been
superb (to quote the famous <i>mot</i>), but it certainly
was not football. It is curious, however, that
amongst the traditions of the city of Chester,
which is one of the oldest homes of the game,
where it was played by all the inhabitants of the
town on the Roodee, the head of a Dane is still
stated to have been the original ball used in the
game. Perhaps it is best to give these two
legends, as in duty bound, and then to pass on
to matters which are of unquestioned historical
accuracy. Indeed, were it not for these legends,
it would seem obvious that the foot-ball, as distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
from the hand-ball, was the product of
civilization and invention. Such indeed it seems
to have been in fact, although it must be confessed
that the subjoined explanation of the origin
of the foot-ball is in part hypothetical and based
upon <i>à priori</i> grounds. It is probable that the
first foot-ball was the Roman <i>follis</i>, or inflated
bladder, of which Martial speaks when he advises
boys and old men alike to play it. But the
<i>follis</i> was, primarily at least, a hand-ball; and a
bladder was probably used first for that purpose,
for the simple reason that it was able, on account
of its lightness, to be struck into the air with the
hand without pain, and with ease. At some
uncertain but momentous date, an impetuous
player must, after missing the ball with his hand,
have kicked out petulantly with his sandalled foot,
and so unconsciously made the first experiment
in the art of drop-kicking, or punting. Swiftly
and strongly the ball flew, farther than it could
be cast by the strongest arm or smitten by the
lustiest hand; and this must inevitably have been
the first step to the later development of the game
played with the <i>follis</i>, when it was kicked with
the foot or struck with the hand at discretion and
convenience.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is probable that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Romans, along with their other habits and
fashions, imported the various games which they
played with the <i>follis</i> or with other kinds of
ball, into England. One of these balls, used by
the Romans, and by them derived from the
Greeks, was the <i>harpastum</i>, the game played with
which was that the players of one side should try
to carry the ball over a line defended by the other
side, a pastime which bears no small resemblance
to the game of “hurling,” which we shall describe
later. But whether football was really introduced
into Britain by the Romans, or whether it be
an indigenous product of the country, yet, with
the exception of the one doubtful reference to
an anonymous manuscript to which allusion has
formerly been made, we do not find any mention
of the game in the annals of our Anglo-Saxon
progenitors; and it is not until the 13th century
that we find genuine historical authority on the
subject.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE first mention of the game of football
in English history is made by Fitz-Stephen,
who, writing in the 13th century, says,
“Annually upon Shrove Tuesday they (the
London school-boys) go into the fields immediately
after dinner and play at the celebrated game
of ball (<i>ludum pilæ celebrem</i>).” But it is only fair
to add, that the learned Strutt himself never felt
certain that the reference here was to football.
He tells us, in his commentary upon the passage,
that Stowe, in his explanation of the words, has
added, “without the least sanction from the
Latin,” the word bastion, “meaning a bat or
cudgel,” being of opinion that the game signified
was something of the nature of goff (golf) or
bandy-ball (<i>sc.</i>, hockey). If Stowe was guilty of
this bold gloss, and there is no question that he
was, then it is clear that the game of the London
school-boys is as likely to have been football as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
anything else, although Strutt is of the contrary
opinion. For Strutt’s view is based upon the
ground that football, as a pastime, “does not seem
to be a very proper game for children.” On the
other hand, there are strong reasons for believing
that this game may have been football, for in the
first place there is good historical evidence to the
effect that Shrove Tuesday was a regular day upon
which the London apprentices and those of other
great cities, such as Chester, and the Scotch
peasants, regularly indulged in the game of football.
This evidence will be set forth immediately.
But it is also a matter to be noted, that London
is one of the places where football seems never
to have died out, while the London schools,
notably Westminster and the Charterhouse, were
the places in which one species of the game
of football was kept alive in a period of great
athletic depression, to emerge, at the time of the
recent athletic revival, in the form of the Association
game.</p>

<p>That this game flourished in the succeeding
century is manifest from the fact that Edward III.,
in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1349, found it necessary to forbid it by
law. This warlike monarch, who was not quite
of the same opinion as a man of at least equally
military mind, the Duke of Wellington, sent a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
formal letter of complaint to the sheriffs of the
City of London, that “the skill in shooting with
arrows was almost totally laid aside for the
purpose of various useless and unlawful games,”
and they were thenceforth enjoined to prohibit all
such “idle practices” as far as their jurisdiction
extended.</p>

<p>Football, however, seemed to have sufficient
vitality to outlast the pressure of a statute which,
like some of those at present directed against
gambling and betting, seems to have been more
honoured in the breach than in the observance,
for we find that in 1389 another Act was passed
by Richard II. (12 Ric. ii., cap. 6) for the purpose
of encouraging shooting, at the expense of other
sports. This Act expressly forbade throughout
the kingdom “all playinge at Tennis, Footballe,
and other games called corts, dice, casting of the
stone, kailes (a kind of skittles), and other such
importune games.” How great must have been
the moral effect of the statute we see from the fact
that it had to be re-enacted by Henry IV. in
1401, and again by Henry VIII. considerably
more than a hundred years later; while the last-named
monarch also passed an enactment rendering
it a penal offence for any person whatever to
attempt to make gain by keeping a house or ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
for sporting purposes of any kind—an enactment
which some of the present managers of “gate-money”
meetings for amateurs would be doubtless
sorry to see replaced upon the Statute Book.
Another clause of the same Act made it a penal
offence for an artificer to play at any of the games
mentioned above, save at Christmastide. In Scotland
also similar measures were pursued for the
purpose of separating those canny sportsmen from
their well-loved games of golf and football; for
in 1458, James III. of Scotland decreed that
displays of weapons were to be held four times
a year, and that “footballe and golfe be utterly
put down.” Two other pieces of evidence show
how constant and how vain was the effort made by
our sovereigns to suppress a national sport. Twice
in the reign of Elizabeth was proclamation made
that “no foteballe play be used or suffered within
the City of London and the liberties thereof, upon
pain of imprisonment,” and twice were entries of
the proclamations having been made entered in the
books of the Corporation of London, upon Nov.
27th, 1572, and Nov. 7th, 1581, where they can
be seen to this day. But in spite of prohibition
and threat of fine and imprisonment, the London
apprentices and the country labourers were determined
to enjoy their football; and the game was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
probably never so flourishing or so prosperous as
it was throughout the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>And now, it may be asked, What manner of
game was this football, which delighted our forefathers
so hugely that they persisted in indulging in
it although under ban of the law? Strange to say,
there was not the chaos of conflicting rules which
were found in use when the game was brought
into prominence again a few decades ago. The
original game appears to have been of the simplest
description. Given two boundaries or goals, a
ball of any make so long as it were strong enough
to prevent its being torn in pieces, and the opposing
sides were allowed to get the ball on and
make it touch the adversaries’ goal in any manner
whatever they pleased, whether by kicking, hurling,
shoving, or running, or by stealth. Sometimes
we hear of goals a mile or more apart; often the
arena of play was a street or a high road, sometimes
a whole town; and the attacking party with
the ball would try and sneak round by bye-streets
in order to escape notice, and plant the ball unawares
through the window or against the post
which was fixed as the goal. The game, in short,
when played in a confined space, was none other
than a rough form of the present Rugby Union
football, without the rules and prohibitions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
have now reduced to order and civilized that
game. But it must have been a rough game,
that of which the yokels and ’prentices of merry
England were so fond; and of broken pates and
aching shins there must have been not a few.
But let us hear what the writers of the age had
to say about it. But before we proceed to give a
few extracts of their views, we must premise that
football was always looked upon as a vulgar game,
a game for clod-hoppers, Irish kernes, and ’prentice
lads, which a gentleman of quality should shun,
lest perchance his eye be blackened or his skin
be raised in lumps by a wight of low degree.
Hence we can only expect the writers of gentle
birth of the age of Elizabeth and James I., and
indeed of all the later ages up to the present
generation, to look upon so rough a game as unfitting
for a man of refinement. But a game does
not need to be defended now because it brings
men of different rank to meet on equal terms with
no favour; and ardent footballers might indeed
be still able to adhere to their game although it
had been deemed vulgar by James I. and by Sir
Thomas Elyot. Nor is there anything in the contempt
of these dignitaries which will depress the
spirits or hurt the sensitive pride of the football-player
especially; for he will find upon study<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
that football was not the only game condemned
by the aristocratic classes. On the contrary,
almost all athletic exercises which did not immediately
and obviously conduce to knightly skill,
were held in equally low esteem; and the game of
cricket itself was equally lightly regarded. In
fact, it is not too much to say, that it was not until
the present century was well advanced that men
of gentle birth and education gave up putting away
boyish sports when they reached man’s estate.
But of this we shall speak later.</p>

<p>The earliest writers who discuss football critically,
are of the Elizabethan era. We have
indeed been informed by a learned antiquary
to whom we are largely indebted for the materials
of this work, that many years before this there
flourished in the City of London a “Guild of
Football Players;” but as our friend has lost his
reference to this, the first Football Club in existence,
and as we have been unable, with much
searching, to recover the clue, we are unable to
present to our readers any report of exciting
matches between the representatives of the various
wards or between the opposing teams of the cities
of London and Westminster. But of the fact
that such an organization existed we feel little or
no doubt, and only regret we cannot give more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
accurate information on the subject. We can
only close our notice of the subject by transcribing
the comment of the gentle scholar to whom
we are indebted for the suggestion, that “probably
the players, recognising the danger of the
game to soul and body, thought it necessary to
combine to employ a special chirurgeon, and a
special chaplain of their own,” from which it will
be seen that our friend is more fond of antiquities
than he is of football.</p>

<p>The first Elizabethan critic of football whose
words deserve quotation, is Sir Thomas Elyot, the
author of “The Boke called the Governour,” a
species of educational manual for the young noblemen
and gentlemen of the age. Writing, in 1583,
of the sports which should be indulged in by those
of gentle birth, he expounds views which, seen
through the glass of the opinions of the nineteenth
century, appear strange. Archery he praises
above tennis, because in tennis a player is compelled
to play as hard as his opponent, and
cannot, so to speak, make his own pace; so that
“if he (the opponent) stryke the balle hard, the
othere that intendeth to receyve him is then constrained
to use semblable violence if he wyll to
retourne the balle.” And “boulynge” (bowls),
“claishe,” and “pinnes” (skittles), and “koyting”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
(quoits), are also spoken of with disfavour as being
too furious; and the writer then goes on (we
quote <i>verbatim</i>, leaving more learned critics to
explain the worthy knight’s grammar): “Verilie
as for two the laste” (<i>i.e.</i>, pinnes and koyting) “be
to be utterly abjected of all noble men, in like
wise foote-balle wherein is nothing but beastlie
furie and exstreme violence, whereof procedeth
hurte and consequently rancour and malice do
remaine with them that be wounded, wherfore
it is to be put in perpetuall silence.” Perhaps
this view would have been coincided with by a
certain bridegroom whom we read elsewhere to
have attended the revels held at Kenilworth in
honour of Queen Elizabeth in 1575, for the
gentleman in question, we gather from a letter of
the gallant Captain Laneham, to have been “lame
of a legge, that in his youth was broeken at foote-balle;”
but modern footballers would hardly agree
with Sir Thomas or with the learned and pious
Puritan writer, Stubbs, who, in our quotations,
“follows on the same side.” Stubbs, in his “Anatomie
of Abuses” in the realm of England in
1583, not only objected to football for itself, but
also for that it was generally played, both in town
and village, on Sunday; and one of his reasons for
believing that the day of doom, as foretold in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Scriptural revelation, was at hand was, that “football-playing
and other develishe pastimes” were
played on Sunday. “Lord,” he prays, “remove
these exercises from the Sabaoth.” What follows
is curious: in answer to a question as to whether
football-playing is a profanation of the Sabbath,
he says, “Any exercise which withdraweth us
from godlinesse, either upon the Sabaoth or any
other day, is wicked and to be forbiden. Now
who is so grossly blinde that seeth not that these
aforesaid exercises not only withdraw us from godlinesse
and virtue, but also haile and allure us to
wickednesse and sin? for as concerning football-playing,
I protest unto you it may rather be called
a friendlie kind of fight than a play or recreation—a
bloody and murthering practise than a felowly
sporte or pastime. For dooth not everyone lye
in waight for his adversarie, seeking to overthrow
him and picke him on his nose, though it be on
hard stones, in ditch or dale, in valley or hill, or
what place soever it be he careth not, so he have
him downe. And he that can serve the most of
this fashion, he is counted the only felow and who
but he.” We may remark incidentally that it is
at least satisfactory to know that the footballers
of the time of Elizabeth appreciated the advantages
of a good “tackler.” But to resume with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Stubbs his opinions. “So that by this means
sometimes their necks are broken, sometimes their
backs, sometimes their legs, sometimes their
armes, sometimes one part thrust out of joint,
sometimes another; sometimes their noses gush
out with blood, sometimes their eyes start out,
and sometimes hurte in one place sometimes in
another. But whosoever scapeth away the best
goeth not scot free but is either forewounded,
craised or bruised so as he dyeth of it or else
scapeth very hardlie, and no mervaile, for they
have the sleights to meet one betwixt two, to dash
him against the hart with their elbowes, to butt
him under the short ribs with the griped fists and
with their knees to catch him on the hip and pick
him on his neck, with a hundred such murthering
devices. And hereof groweth envy, rancour, and
malice, and sometimes brawling murther, homicide,
and great effusion of blood, as experience daily
teacheth. Is this murthering play now an exercise
for the Sabaoth day?”</p>

<p>So much for the opinion of the pious Stubbs,
who, it must be recollected, was a Puritan, and
one of the party who afterwards almost succeeded
in entirely putting down football during the supremacy
of their opinions. Perhaps it will be as well
to finish the hostile criticism with the opinion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
King James I. of England, who, in his Basilicon
Doron, a manual of education written for his son,
after speaking in praise of various other sports,
saith, “but from this count I debar all rough and
violent exercise, as the foot-ball meeter for laming
than making able the users thereof.” Still James
I., taking him for all in all, was something of an
old woman, and can hardly have been expected to
look with favour upon a “charge” or a “scrimmage.”
Added to this, we have something more
than a suspicion that his Royal Highness, while
posing as an original writer on education, was
drawing a great many of his views from Sir Thomas
Elyot; for the Basilicon Doron bears a most
suspicious resemblance in many places to the work
of the earlier writer.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best description we have of the
game at this period comes from Carew’s “Survey
of Cornwall,” published in 1602. Carew gives a
long account of the game of “hurling,” which was
another form of the football we have described
above, with the addition that the players were
allowed, if they liked, to carry sticks and hit the
ball towards the goal, besides hurling, kicking,
hitting, or running with it. We thus see, as would
naturally be expected, that hockey and football
started as the same sport but gradually “differentiated”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
into separate games, according to the true
Darwinian law of progress. Hurling is described
as a match between two large parties of men, in
which each side strives to get the ball as best it
can up to the adversaries’ goal. Carew, who is a
more genial critic than Elyot, Stubbs, or King
James I., describes hurling with much carefulness
and acuteness of observation. “For hurling to
goales there are 15, 20, or 30 players, more or less,
chosen out on each side, who strip themselves to
their slightest apparel and then join hands in ranke
one against another; out of these ranks they
matche themselves by payres, one embracing another,
and so passe away, every of which couple
are especially to watch one another during the
play.” What football-player knows not the phrase,
“Mark your men”? “After this, they pitch two
bushes in the ground, some eight or ten feet
asunder, and directly against them, ten or twelve
score paces off, other twain in like distance, which
they term goales, where some indifferent person
throweth up a balle, the which whosoever can
catch and carry through the adversaries’ goals hath
won the game.” The hurlers also, we learn, were
not allowed to <i>but</i> or <i>handfast</i> (charge or collar)
under the girdle, or to “deale a foreballe” <i>i.e.</i>, to
pass forward to one nearer the goal than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
player, in which passage we have the only explicit
reference to “off-side” play which is to be found in
the early annals of the game. Besides the game
in a field of play, there was also, we learn from
Carew, a game played over country. “Two
three or more parishes agree to hurl against two
or three other parishes.” In this game the goals
were usually houses, or else villages, three or four
miles asunder, and “that company which can
catch or carry it by force or slight to the place
assigned, gaineth the victory. Such as see where
the ball is played give notice, by crying, ‘Ware east,’
‘Ware west,’ as the same is carried. The hurlers
take their way over hilles, dales, hedges, ditches,
yea, and thorow bushes, briars, mires, plashes and
rivers whatsoever, so as you shall sometimes see
twenty or thirty lie tugging together in the water,
scrambling and scratching for the ball.” This
description of what may be described as a “maul
in pond” is certainly interesting, and the whole
description of the game lucid. The criticism of
the game is also eminently sensible. “The play
is verily both rude and rough, yet such as is not
destitute of policies in some sort resembling the
feats of war; for you shall have companies laid
out before, on the one side to encounter them that
come with the ball, and of the other party to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
succour them in manner of a fore-ward.” (Thus
we see that the term “forward” in football is no
ill-chosen one, the “fore-wards” or “fore-guards”
being those who bear the first attack, and protect
the rear-guards, who are manœuvring behind.)
Carew goes on, “The ball in this play may be
compared to an infernal spirit, for whosoever catcheth
it fareth straightways like a madman struggling
and fighting with those that go about to hold
him: no sooner is the ball gone from him than he
resigneth this fury to the next receiver, and himself
becometh peaceable as before.” (Perhaps, we
may here remark, the man who lost the ball became
peaceable because he was by that time well
“blown.” We have observed the same ourselves
in the present age.) Carew ends up with some
very thoughtful criticism of the game, “I cannot
well resolve,” he says, “whether I should the more
commend this game for its manhood and exercise,
or condemn it for the boisterousness and harm
which it begetteth; for as on the one side it makes
their bodies strong, hard, and nimble, and puts a
courage into their hearts to meet an enemy in the
face, so on the other part it is accompanied by
many dangers, some of which do ever fall to the
players’ share, for the proof whereof when the
hurling is ended, you shall see them retiring home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
as from a pitched battle, with bloody pates, bones
broken and out of joint, and such bruises as serve
to shorten their days; yet all is good play, and
never attorney or coroner troubled for the matter.”</p>

<p>Perhaps one more extract will be sufficient to
show that <i>circiter</i> <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1600, football was considered
one of the national sports of England, just as
it is to-day. Here is a list of British games in the
year 1600. Quoth one bold swain to another his
rival (in verse):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Man, I dare challenge thee to throw the sledge,</div>
<div class="verse">To jumpe, or leape over a ditch or hedge;</div>
<div class="verse">To wrastle, play at stooleballe, or to runne,</div>
<div class="verse">To pitch the barre, or to shoote off a gunne;</div>
<div class="verse">To play at loggets, nine-holes, or ten pinnes,</div>

</div></div>

<p>Perhaps, gentle reader, we may have more to say
anon about the ancient sports of the age of
Shakspeare, but at present we must needs jog on.
Let not our readers think, however, that the Bard
of Avon never heard of football. Let them look
to the “Comedy of Errors,” Act ii. Scene 6,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Am I so round with you as you with me,</div>
<div class="verse">That like a football you do spurn me thus?</div>
<div class="verse">You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></div>
<div class="verse">If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Lear too, and Kent, knew something about
“hacking” and “tripping.” Listen to this, “Lear,”
Act i. Scene 4.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Lear.</i> Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?</p>

<p><i>Steward.</i> I’ll not be strucken, my lord.</p>

<p><i>Kent.</i> Nor tripped neither, you base football-player
(tripping up his heels).</p>

<p><i>Lear.</i> I thank thee, fellow.</p>
</div>

<p>Lear, you see, breaks out into an exclamation of
praise, when he sees a neat “trip” brought off by
Kent.</p>

<p>There are still some ancient customs in relation
to the game of football, which belong to no particular
age, as many of them endured through
many ages, but which may well be set out here lest
they should pass out of mind. The following is
from MS. Harl. 2150, fol. 235:—“It hath been
the custom, time out of mind, for the shoemakers
yearly on Shrove Tuesday to deliver to the drapers,
in the presence of the Mayor of Chester, at the
cross on the Rodehee, one ball of leather called a
foote-ball, of the value of three shillings and fourpence
and above, to play at from thence to the
Common Hall of the said city; which practice was
productive of much inconvenience; and this year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
(1540), by consent of the parties concerned, the
ball was changed into six glayves of silver of the
like value, as a reward for the best runner that day
upon the aforesaid Rodehee.”</p>

<p>At the parish of Scone, in Perthshire, a similar
game appears to have been played every Shrove
Tuesday, between the bachelors and the married
men, from two o’clock until sunset. The game was
initiated by the throwing up of the ball in the
neighbourhood of the market cross at Scone, and
the account of it may well be given in the words
of the author of “The Statistical Account of Scotland,”
as quoted by Hone in his Year-Book of 1838.
The game was this: “He who at any time got the
ball into his hands ran with it till overtaken by
one of the opposite party, and then, if he could
shake himself loose from those of the opposite
party who seized him, he ran on; if not, he
threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested
from him by the other party, <i>but no person was
allowed to kick it</i>. The object of the married
men was to hang it, that is, to put it three times
into a small hole in the moor, which was the
‘dool,’ or limit, on the one hand; that of the
bachelors was to drown it, or dip it three times in
a deep place in the river, the limit on the other;
the party who could effect either of these objects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
won the game; if neither won, the ball was cut
into equal parts at sunset. In the course of the
play there was usually some violence between the
parties; but it is a proverb in this part of the
country, that ‘All is fair at the ball at Scone.’”
This annual game is supposed to have been established
in commemoration of the victory of a
parishioner of Scone over an Italian braggadocio
of chivalrous times; and every man in the parish
was compelled to play. Thus, in this Perthshire
game we seem to find the rough and rude instance
of the original game in Scotland, and the first instance
of compulsory football. It should further
be remarked, that the same antiquary gives an
account of an annual Shrove Tuesday football
match between the married women of Inverness
and the spinsters of the same parish, which, according
to him, invariably resulted in the triumph of
the married women. It appears, therefore, that
the female elevens which occasionally appear in
North Country football fields, are not without a
respectable historical precedent for their acts. Still,
it is pardonable to say that the game is not exactly
suitable to their physical constitution; and even the
sturdy lass of Inverness must have been somewhat
out of place in the game which Waller describes
with reasonable accuracy in the following lines:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“As when a sort of lustie shepherd’s boy</div>
<div class="verse">Their force at football; care of victory</div>
<div class="verse">Makes them salute so rudely breast to breast,</div>
<div class="verse">That their encounter seems too rough for jest.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>A game of similar character to “the ball at
Scone” appears also to have been played yearly at
Kingston-on-Thames on Shrove Tuesday, which,
as we shall see later, continued an annual fixture
until far into the present century.</p>

<p>Sunday was a great day for all sports and pastimes
throughout the Tudor times; and it was long
indeed before the Puritan reaction caused them
to be entirely stopped on that day. There is an
amusing extract from Thomas Cartwright’s Admonition
to Parliament, which gives some material
for the formation of an idea of the manner in which
our forefathers spent the Sunday. It should be
mentioned that the learned writer originally wrote
with the object of showing that an established
form of prayer was unsuitable for church service.
“Among his arguments,” says the easily-satisfied
historian, “is the following:—‘He,’ meaning the
minister, ‘posteth it over as fast as he can galloppe;
for eyther he hath two places to serve, or
else there are some games to be playde in the
afternoon, as lying for the whetstone, heathenishe
dauncing for the ring, a beare or a bulle to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
baited, or else a jackanapes to ride on horsebacke,
or an interlude to be playde. And, if no place
else can be gotten, this interlude must be plaide
in the church.’” And, in order that a clear idea
of the details of Sunday life may be obtained,
the antiquary adds an extract from “The Pope’s
Kingdom” (1570), translated from the Latin of
T. Neorgeorgus by Barnaby Googe:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Now when the dinner our is done, and that they well have fed,</div>
<div class="verse">To play they go; to casting of the stone, to runne or shoote;</div>
<div class="verse">To tosse the light and windy ball aloft with hand or foote;</div>
<div class="verse">Some others trie their skille in gonnes; some wrastel all the day;</div>
<div class="verse">And some to schooles of fence do goe, to gaze upon the play;</div>
<div class="verse">Another sort there is that does not love abroad to roame,</div>
<div class="verse">But for to pass their time at cardes, or tables, still at home.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Writings of this kind were abundant in the time
of Elizabeth, and eventually became so influential as
to cause that most prudent of stateswomen to issue
a general proclamation enjoining a more strict observance
of the Sabbath. It would be most erroneous,
however, to trace in this proclamation any
characteristic quality of Elizabeth other than natural
prudence, for there have been few English monarchs,
male or female, to whom the Puritan tenets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
were more distasteful at heart than they were to
the peerless but somewhat out-spoken virgin
queen. James I., for whom Strutt has a great
admiration, repeated this declaration in general;
but he, as a timid man, averse to muscular exercise,
and an indifferent sportsman, had a rooted objection
to football, which, as we have stated before,
was not wonderful.</p>

<p>Enough has now been written to prove that the
game of football is, in name at least, of extreme
antiquity, and to give a general idea of its characteristics
in early times. But it may not be amiss
to examine these latter in more detail. It is to be
noted in the first place that there appear in early
days to have been hardly any rules; but it is nevertheless
possible to discover certain general characteristics.
The main principle of the game appears
to have been, that a ball should be driven from one
place to another; but as to the means appropriate
to its conveyance, there would seem to have been
a great difference. The men of Perthshire never,
by any chance, kicked the ball; the Southerners
kicked, carried, and struck it with their hands or
with sticks.</p>

<p>But for any trace of what is now known as the
Association game, in which almost the only method
of propulsion of the ball allowed is by kicking with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the feet, we look in vain in ancient times. It
seems probable that such a game originated in
schools, and was confined to them, until brought
before the public as a pastime for men by school-boys
from the great public foundations, who wished
to continue their games after they had left school
for the world. The real and substantial difference
between the two games as at present played is,
that in the Association game no collaring, and
therefore no running with the ball, is allowed; so
that it may be not unsafe to conjecture that the
dribbling game was invented, or rather grew, in
schools where young boys were not allowed to
tear each others’ clothes and break each others’
bones in the intervals of school hours. But of
the Association game we shall have more to say
anon.</p>

<p>We think we have said enough of the history of
the game of football in the days preceding the
Great Revolution and the Puritan supremacy.
This was a period in which the star of athleticism
waned to an exceeding paleness; and there is no
question that those who appreciate the benefits of
innocent enjoyment in exercise of the body, owe
a deep debt of enmity to the Roundheads. With
their politics, their religion, their love of independence,
and with many other points good and bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
in their character, we have no concern in the
present work.</p>

<p>The death of Charles on the scaffold, the
history of the Long Parliament, Cromwell with
his spot of blood upon his collar, the steeple-crowned
hats, and the sad-coloured cloaks touch
us not at all. But the influence which the
Puritans exercised in determining the pastimes of
the nation is a serious matter. From an athletic
point of view, the Puritan creed is this—“Be
always morose, always ponderous, absorbed in
continual thought and everlasting sermonizing
concerning your latter end. Now, if you play
football or cricket, or indulge in any English
pastimes, you will unquestionably forget your
latter end, and will develop such a healthy energy
as will be fatal to despondent bitterness of spirit,
which makes the true Puritan.” The result was
simple. Exercise was a waste of time, innocent
pleasure an unwarrantable pampering of the flesh,
an unholy coaxing of the old Adam. Now we
all know the result of insufficient exercise to be
derangement of the liver, the spleen, and all
organs and functions of the body. Upon this
follows loss of temper, which passes from the
condition of casual irritability to that of unrelenting
and constitutional rancour. Thus men of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
dispositions naturally bitter and gloomy, not only
took steps to develop their naturally ungracious
tendencies, but also sought to run the rest of the
nation into the same mould. They did their
endeavour to convert merry England,—for we
were once, in very truth, the merriest of nations,—into
a melancholy country; and it may well be
believed that the Restoration was due as much to
weariness of the Puritan discipline in matters of
daily life and amusement, as to any strong
political feeling. The rule of politics which the
Puritans seem to have forgotten, is the practical
one, that the first principle of good government is
to keep the people who are governed in a good
humour. The natural result of a system which
inculcated bitterness of thought, fostered ill-humour,
and encouraged conceit, was, that it
should perish at the hands of the bitterness, the
ill-humour, and conceit which it had itself engendered.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>FTER the downfall of the Puritan Government
and of the supremacy of Puritan
opinions, as every student of history
well knows, the Maypoles were set up again in
the country, and simple folk resumed their dancing
and the like rustic sports. But it is rather the
fashion of concise historians to represent changes
of this kind as more rapid than they are in actual
fact; and it is probably nearer the truth to say that
the Puritan habits and feelings which came over
England in the earlier part of the 17th century
have never really lost their hold of the nation, and
are even in this day dying hard. Certain it is, at
any rate, if any certainty can be gathered from
the literature which is, as it were, the crystallized
thought of an age, that until the present generation
athletic sports have never so much formed a
part of the life of the English people as they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
before the Puritan epoch. The direction of a
straw is sufficient to show which way the wind is
blowing; and the apparently insignificant fact that
references to football and other early English games
are rare in the literature of the eighteenth century,
is almost sufficient in itself to prove the decrease
in the popularity of the game. Some old towns
and districts clung to the ancient and simple form
of the game, and cling to it still up to the present
day; but it will not be too much to say, that from
the date of the Restoration until the time of the
great athletic revival in the last thirty or forty
years, the popularity of the ancient game of football
was steadily declining, though never in any
danger of complete extinction. Let us give the
generation who abandoned their ardour for football
their due, and say that they became more
serious, more earnest, and less brutal in their
sports. The fact, however, of the decline in the
popularity of the game remains the same, and
with the chronicling of that fact we must remain
content. So early as 1675 we learn from a satire
that the apprentices of London were no longer
content with a game of football on Shrove Tuesday
or any such holiday, but preferred the by no means
modern amusement of a political demonstration.
Says the anonymous satirist of the ’prentices,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“They’re mounted high, contemn the humble play</div>
<div class="verse">Of rap or foot-ball on a holiday</div>
<div class="verse">In Fines-bury-fieldes. No; ’tis their brave intent</div>
<div class="verse">Wisely t’ advise the king and parliament.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Still the city youths were not always indulging
in demonstrations about this time, and a number
of games of football were played about the metropolis
after the Restoration. In 1665 Pepys records
in his diary that on January the 2nd, the streets
were full of footballs, it being a great frost.
Probably the footballers of that time did not play
football for choice when the ground was frozen;
but a long frost meant a long holiday and cessation
from business in those good old times, and the
’prentices therefore got an opportunity of playing
the game which they would not have had in open
weather. We hear too of a match played in 1681
between the servants of King Charles II. and
those of the Duke of Albemarle, which the king
witnessed himself and was much delighted at. A
few years later, there was enough football in
London to attract the notice of a French visitor,
M. Misson, who published his views of England
at the end of the 17th century in a book brought
out at Paris in the year 1698, and entitled
“Mémoires et Observations Faites par un
Voyageur.” We need hardly wonder that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Frenchman in his description of the game should
be unable to appreciate its exact significance.
Simple as the game undoubtedly was in these days,
there was probably a little more “science” in it
than the visitor to our shores could comprehend.
These are his words: “En hiver le Football est un
exercice utile et charmant. C’est un balon de cuir,
gros comme la tête et rempli de vent: cela se
balotte avec le pied dans les rues par celui qui le
peut attraper: il n’y a point d’autre science.” From
this very short allusion in a long work some very
interesting pieces of information are to be derived.
First, it appears that at this time the football had
definitely assumed somewhat of its present shape:
it was a leather ball, full of wind, as large as a
man’s head. Next we find that football was
definitely regarded by a foreigner as a regular
winter sport in England, and that it was still
played as an ordinary matter of course in the
streets or public places. A third inference may
possibly be drawn from the passage. M. Misson
speaks of no running or collaring, but merely of
kicking with the feet. Here at last might the
dribbler think that we find a definite allusion to
the original dribbling or Association game. After
consideration, however, we think that a different
explanation of the passage is probably to be given.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
From the description we have quoted, it seems
probable that the writer had not seen a genuine
football match, but merely boys or men kicking
a football about the streets for amusement,—in
modern phraseology “having a punt-about.”
Whichever interpretation of the passage, however,
be taken, it seems not improbable that it was from
the custom of punting a ball about in a confined
space for the sake of obtaining warmth and
exercise upon a cold day, without any running
with the ball or rough horseplay, that the proficiency
in dribbling and kicking was first obtained
and the capacities of the dribbling game for
affording a genuine sport full of skill and excitement
first discovered. On the whole, however,
there is little doubt that the Association game
must be regarded as the product of the great
public schools of the kingdom, and not so much
the national sport of the lower classes.</p>

<p><i>The Spectator</i>, which in other respects forms a
mine of wealth for procuring information as to the
customs and opinions of England in the beginning
of the 18th century, is, unfortunately for our
purpose, almost entirely silent as to the game of
football. There is, however, an illusion in No.
161 (Sept. 4th, 1711). A supposed country correspondent,
a dweller in the neighbourhood of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
estate of Sir Roger de Coverley, writes to <i>The
Spectator</i> in town an account of a country wake.
First the writer finds “a ring of cudgel-players,
who were breaking one anothers’ heads in order
to make some impression upon their mistresses’
hearts.” “I observed,” he goes on, “a lusty
young fellow who had the misfortune of a broken
pate, but what considerably added to the anguish
of the wound, was his overhearing an old man who
shook his head and said, ‘that he questioned now
if black Kate would marry him these three years.’
I was diverted from a further observation of these
combatants by a football match which was on the
other side of the green, where Tom Short behaved
himself so well that most people seemed to agree
it was impossible that he should remain a bachelor
until the next wake. Having played many a
match myself, I could have looked longer on the
sport, had I not observed a country girl.”...
And so, forsooth, the <i>Spectator’s</i> country correspondent
gives up the further contemplation and
probably the further description of a manly game,
in order that he may gaze at a country wench, to
the great detriment and loss of knowledge of the
football student of the present day. O woman,
woman, how many omissions are to be laid to thy
charge through the vanity and curiosity of man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
when he gazeth upon thee! At any rate, however,
we gather from the passage that in the 18th
century the country people played at football in
holiday time on the village green, that country
gentlemen joined in the matches, and that the
most skilful players gained the favour and encouragement
of the fair sex, and were not destined
to remain bachelors for ever. Verily, ye gentlemen
of Blackheath, times are changed, but not manners.</p>

<p>In writing however of the 18th century, the
learned Strutt is the safest guide, for his compilations
and researches into matters of ancient
sport take us up to the end of the 18th century.
From Strutt we learn how the game was gradually
being abandoned throughout the country about the
year 1800. “Of late years,” he says, “it seems to
have fallen into disrepute, and is but little practised.”
We see, however, from his amusing description
which follows, that by his time it had become
a field sport, and was played upon a regular football
field, and doubtless with touch-lines and goal-lines.
Unfortunately he makes no mention of the number
of players who are usually engaged in the contest,
and gives us little or no hint of any rule, or any
explanation of what was considered scientific play.
“When,” he says, “a match at football is made,
two parties, each containing an equal number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
competitors, take the field, and stand between two
goals, placed at the distance of eighty or an
hundred yards the one from the other. The goal
is usually made with two sticks driven into the
ground about two or three feet apart. The ball,
which is commonly made of a blown bladder and
cased with leather, is delivered in the midst of
the ground, and the object of each party is to
drive it through the goal of the other, which being
achieved the game is won.... When the
exercise becomes exceeding violent, the players
kick each others’ shins without the least ceremony,
and some of them are overthrown at the
hazard of their limbs.” He garnishes his simple
account with some elegant extracts from Barclay
and Waller, such as—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The sturdie plowman, lustie, strong, and bold,</div>
<div class="verse">Overcometh the winter by driving the foote-ball,</div>
<div class="verse">Forgetting labour and many a grievous fall.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>and again—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“And now in winter when men kill the fat swine,</div>
<div class="verse">They get the bladder and blow it great and thin,</div>
<div class="verse">With many beans and peason put therein:</div>
<div class="verse">It rattleth, soundeth, and shineth clere and fayre;</div>
<div class="verse">While it is thrown and caste up in the ayre,</div>
<div class="verse">Each one contendeth and hath a great delite</div>
<div class="verse">With foot and with hand, the bladder for to smite;</div>
<div class="verse">If it fall to ground they lift it up again,</div>
<div class="verse">And this waye to labour they count it no payne.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>From the time of Strutt, whose book was published
in 1801, until the great revival of the game,
about fifty years later, there is little to chronicle in
the history of the game, which was played at almost
all the great schools; but, as regards the rest of the
world, only popular in certain localities where great
matches were played by those who adhered to
ancient customs. In fact, we find from the mention
made of the game by Hone, the author of
the “Every Day Book and Year Book,” that football
for men was looked upon as more or less of
a relic of antiquity in England. There was the
celebrated match at Kingston on Shrove Tuesday,
at Corfe Castle in Dorsetshire, the equally celebrated
antiquity at Derby, at which city, as reported
by Glover, its learned historian, a match had been
played every year on Shrove Tuesday since <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
217, when a troop of British warriors thrust some
Roman troops out of the gates. But what Hone
states of England seems never to have applied to
Scotland and a few northern counties of England,
where the game has enjoyed an uninterrupted
popularity among the inhabitants of the country.
But perhaps a better idea can be obtained by
giving some of Hone’s extracts. On page 152 of
his “Year Book” (1852), he quotes, from Hutchinson’s
“History of Cumberland,” an account of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
the football match at Bromfield, on Shrove Tuesday.
The scholars of the free school in that place
were allowed by custom to “bar out” the master
for three days; after a mock fight with popguns
and harmless missiles, a truce was solemnly concluded,
one of the terms of which was, that a
football match should be permitted, as well as
some cock-fighting. “After the cock-fighting was
ended,” says the account, “the football was thrown
down in the churchyard, and the point then contended
was, which party should carry it to the
house of his respective captain—to Dundraw
perhaps or West Newton, a distance of two or
three miles. The details of these matches were
the general topics of conversation among the
villagers, and were dwelt on with hardly less satisfaction
than their ancestors enjoyed in relating
their feats in the border wars.” A quotation of an
indigenous song is also given, which runs as
follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“At Scales, great Tom Barmes got the ba’ in his hand,</div>
<div class="verse">And t’wives all ran out and shouted and banned;</div>
<div class="verse">Tom Cowan then pulched and flang him ’mang t’ whins,</div>
<div class="verse">And he bleddered ‘Od-white-te’ tou’s broken my shins.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>An account of a similar game at Kingston in
the year 1815, is given in the “Every Day Book,”
vol. i., p. 245.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>A correspondent writes to the Editor to say that
when travelling by the Hampton Court coach to
Kingston on Shrove Tuesday, he was told that it
was “Football Day,” and “was not a little amused
to see, upon entering Teddington, all the inhabitants
securing the glass of their front windows by placing
hurdles before them, and some by nailing laths.
At Twickenham, Bushy, and Hampton Wick they
were all engaged in the same way. Having to
stop a few hours at Kingston, I had an opportunity
of seeing the whole custom.... At about 12
o’clock the ball is turned loose, and those who can
kick it. I observed some persons of respectability
following the ball: the game lasts about four hours,
when the parties retire to the public-houses.”...
The writer goes on to say that the corporation of
Kingston tried to put a stop to the practice; but
the judges confirmed the right to the game.</p>

<p>Another correspondent, whose letter is published
on page 374 of vol. ii. of the same book, describes
how at that time (viz. 1827), a game of football
was played every Sunday afternoon by Irishmen,
upon an open space at Islington. The game
commenced at three, and lasted until dusk, men
of one county, as a rule, playing against men of
another. The same writer goes on to say that when
he was a boy he was accustomed to play football<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
on a Sunday morning in the “church-piece” before
church-time, in a village in the West of England;
but from the tone of the letter it appears very
evident that the writer looked upon football at that
day as a game more of the past than of the present.</p>

<p>In Scotland, however, football in this age was
still a national pastime, and extensively patronized
by the upper classes. In 1815 we read of a great
football match being played at Carterhaugh in
Ettrick Forest, between the Ettrick men and the
men of Yarrow; the one party backed by the Earl
of Home, and the other by Sir Walter Scott, then
Sheriff of the forest. The latter wrote a couple of
songs in honour of the occasion, from one of which
we quote a verse,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Then strip, lads, and to it, though sharp be the weather;</div>
<div class="indent">And if by mischance you should happen to fall,</div>
<div class="verse">There are worse things in life than a tumble on heather,</div>
<div class="indent">And life is itself but a game of football.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is perhaps scarcely necessary to quote the
lines from the “Lay of the Last Minstrel,” of the
same poet, when, in the truce between the English
and Scottish armies, sports were indulged in:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Some drive the jolly bowl about;</div>
<div class="indent">With dice and draughts some chase the day;</div>
<div class="verse">And some, with many a merry shout,</div>
<div class="indent">In riot, revelry, and rout,</div>
<div class="verse">Pursue the football play.”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>But independently of these extracts, there are many
allusions through Scott’s works which testify to the
acknowledged popularity of football in Scotland in
the lifetime of the great novelist.</p>

<p>Perhaps we cannot do better than conclude our
account of the football of the past before the days
of the Rugby Union and Association rules by referring
to the ancient game which is still played at
Derby on Shrove Tuesday at the present, though
perhaps played with less zest since the lusty youths
of the city have had plenty of opportunities of
enjoying the game to the top of their bent on other
occasions, and since too we live in an age which
has more respect for the privileges and feelings of
peaceable householders than its predecessors. At
Derby there has been from time immemorial a
match at football on Shrove Tuesday, between the
rival parishes of All Saints and St. Peter. The
game is started in the market-place, and the St.
Peter’s goal is a gate some miles away, while the
wheel of a water-mill, distant about as far, is the
goal of the All Saints’ division; and the game is
over when the ball has been taken to either goal.
Rules of the game there are none; and all that is
needed is for one party, by force or by stratagem, to
get the ball up to the adversary’s goal; to effect
which object, <i>détours</i> are made round streets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
alleys, and the river often crossed by swimming
with the ball. Here indeed is a survival of one of
the ancient sports of merrie England, where blows
are given and taken in good humour, and “all is
good play, and never attorney or coroner troubled
for the matter.” Nor is Derby by any means the
only place where such a game is still played. In
the Midlands, the North, the South, and the West
it survives in holes and corners of old England;
and although we who have learnt the game of football
in other days may prefer a good match with
picked sides on the regulation field of play and
under organized rules, yet we should regard with
veneration the more simple sport from which has
been derived the more elaborate game which it
was our delight to play in youth, and which it may
be our delight to watch in old age. We must
reserve for another chapter the important task
of showing how, issuing from its home in the
public schools, where it had for generations found
a welcome shelter, the game of football has developed
once more in our days into a national
sport.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T is vastly to the credit of cricket and of
football that they should have survived the
Puritan deluge and the decay of the athletic
spirit at the end of the last century, and not have
been laid in limbo together with stoolball, cambuc,
and other games wherein the hearts of our
forefathers rejoiced. The survival indicates an
exceeding fitness. Still the storm of Puritanical
hatred had been enough to kill even hardier plants
than these, unless there had been some quiet
haunts in which they existed unnoticed and unmolested.
As to the pastimes of the ’prentice boys
they perished; but in the quiet privacy of the
country and in the almost monastic seclusion of
some of our ancient public schools they continued
to exist.</p>

<p>For some reason or other, the foundation of
Laurence Sheriff, at Rugby, was the locality in
which, what we now call the Rugby game, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
which, for reasons above mentioned, appears in
reality to have been the pristine form of the
game, was preserved. Now, since of every effect
there is a cause, and since of this particular effect
history supplies no cause that we are aware of,
it becomes necessary to have recourse to conjecture;
and since conjecture, to be probable,
must proceed upon some sound basis, it seems
to follow, that in order to discover why the game,
distinguished by an absence of rules, survived in
Rugby School, an inquiry should be made whether
the conditions of football at Rugby were not
different from what they were elsewhere. The
answer to this question, once formulated, is manifest.
The conditions of football were different
at Rugby from those which prevailed at other
schools; or rather, to put the matter in language
paradoxical in appearance but literally correct, the
conditions of the game were normal at Rugby and
abnormal everywhere else. In fact, the original
form of football,—for it is the simplest,—is of
such a nature that it can hardly be played except
in a wide open space. Such a space existed at
Rugby from the beginning, but not at the other
great public schools. The Eton boys had originally
no other place to disport themselves in than
the comparatively small inner field nearest the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
College buildings. The ancient Meads of the
Winchester College are small in dimensions. At
the Charterhouse they had originally no other
playground than the cloisters; and though at
Westminster the scholars were better provided
for, yet they were confined to “Green.” Now, in
small spaces of this kind it is obvious that the
continual playing of football throughout the winter
months must, almost of necessity, have resulted
in the ruin of the playground for other purposes.
For football is essentially a game for the many,
and not for the few, and by its very nature
involves the tearing up of turf and the ruin of
greenswards. Therefore it was natural that in
each particular school the rules of the game
should be settled by the capacities of the playground;
and, as these were infinitely various in
character, so were the games various.</p>

<p>It is proposed to examine the games of the
various schools in somewhat close detail, on the
ground, in the first place, that they are interesting
in themselves, and, in the second, that in some
of them at least are to be traced, more or less
distinctly, the germs of the Association game.</p>

<p>The most peculiar of all games of football is
that which is practised at Winchester, and which,
in defiance of latter-day opinions, still continues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to flourish in almost its pristine form. Of the
peculiar rules in vogue at Winchester College, it
cannot be written that they are in any way concerned
with the principles of the Association
game. On the contrary, they differ altogether
from those of any other game. But the Winchester
rules have the literary merit of peculiarity,
and this practical virtue, that they have produced
many of the first Association players of the
present and past days. Therefore, although no
one is recommended to submit himself to them
if he can avoid it, which he will not be able to
do if he goes to the ancient school as a pupil,
they are rules worthy of some notice. The ground
upon which the Winchester boys play, is about
80 yards long and about 25 yards wide. Thus,
in the College Meads, which are more or less
square, with an irregular excrescence upon the
side nearest the College, it was possible for four
games to be played simultaneously, while the
central portion was reserved for the more sacred
and elaborate game of cricket. Inasmuch, however,
as there was some natural difficulty in
keeping the ball within the prescribed limits for
even a reasonable time, the ancient custom was
first to mark out the ground with stakes and ropes,
and then, outside the ropes, to place a line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
shivering fags. In time humanity and genius
combined discovered that hurdles served the
purpose quite as well as small boys, and did not
take cold; and in later days the hurdles themselves
have given place to tarred nets, spread out
upon an iron framework some ten feet in height.
The ropes still remain and are placed about a yard
from the netting; and further, seeing that the ball,
while it is “under ropes,” is in a certain spurious
kind of way in play, these same ropes exert a serious
influence upon the game. This commences with
a “hot,” which is formed in the following fashion:
In “sixes,” that is to say matches with six players
on each side, there are two backs on each side,
who are called “behinds,” and four forwards, who
go by the name of “ups.” Of the forwards one
is “over the ball” and takes the centre place, and
two back him up with their knees behind his and
their arms interlaced round his body. All three
keep their heads down, and the fourth, with his
back and shoulders, propels the centre man. In
a six game, notwithstanding the closeness of the
phalanx thus formed, the duration of a “hot” is
not usually long; but in fifteens, where the mass
of players is far greater and the same principle
is observed in the formation of the “hot,” ten
minutes or more may be occupied in this performance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
When it is added that the performance is
deliberately repeated every time the ball is kicked
over the netting, and that there is no other penalty
than a “hot” for any infringement of the rules,
it may be imagined that “hots” occupy the
greater part of the hour which is devoted to a
match. The ball, however, is not kicked out as
often as might be supposed probable, for one of
the most stringent rules of the game is, that it
may not be kicked higher than five feet, which
is supposed to be the average height of a man’s
shoulder, unless, at the time when it is kicked,
it is either bounding or rolling at a distinctly fast
pace; nor may it be kicked up unless the last
person to touch it was an opponent, for, in the contrary
case, it is a “made flier,” which is dreadful.
This is a rule which causes almost as many hots
by being infringed as it saves by preventing the
behinds, who alone do much in the way of kicking,
from driving the ball over the netting. Still
it is a necessary rule, for the goal consists of the
whole twenty-five yards or thereabouts, that is to
say, of the whole width of the arena, and but for
the rule concerning “kicking up,” there would be
no end to the number of goals obtained. It
should be mentioned, however, that if a ball,
before passing over the goal line, or, as it is called,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
“Worms,” is touched ever so slightly by any
member of what Strutt would call the defending
party, no goal is scored. The distinguishing
features of the game, apart from those already
mentioned, are, in the first place, that no dribbling
is permitted under any circumstances; and in the
second place, that the “off-side” rule is stricter
than in any other game. It is not legitimate for
two players on the same side to touch the ball in
succession, unless it rolls behind the first kicker;
nor may one player “back up his partner’s kick”
by charging the adversary, unless, at the time when
his partner kicked, he was behind the ball, or,
since that time, has returned to the place from
which the ball was kicked. It should be added,
that the ball, which is several ounces heavier than
an Association ball, is round. When caught upon
a full volley kicked by one of the opposite side,
it is “punted” and not “dropped;” but if the
person catching it is charged, then he who charges
is said to be “running him” and may “collar”
him as at the Rugby game, and the holder of the
ball may run until his adversaries cease to “run
him,” but then he must halt and take his punt.</p>

<p>Enough has now been said to give to the general
public an idea of the Winchester game. To a
Wykehamist, all that has been written is, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
would say, the vilest “Tugs,” or news twice told;
to interest him, it would be necessary to enter into
an elaborate discussion of the vexed question contained
in the words “Under Ropes Play.” But
to the outside world this vast problem will be
sufficiently explained by the bare statement that
when, towards the end of the allotted time, the
heavier side discovers that it is one goal or so
ahead, it is a very simple matter to keep the ball
under ropes, in the midst of a surging and
tumultuous crowd, until the hour ends.</p>

<p>The characteristics of the Winchester game are,
that it requires great pace and dash in the players,
and teaches men to kick with great accuracy. It
is, however, so manly and straightforward a game
that it leaves little room for skill or subtlety.
Moreover, it is noticeable for this, that while it has
been the training-ground of many excellent players,
it has also brought into prominence men who never
could have excelled under any other conditions.
These are the “under-ropes” players, whose system
is that of the ox—heavy, obstinate, and slow.</p>

<p>Corresponding in a certain measure to the
Winchester game, is the Eton game of football at
the Wall. That is to say, its character and rules
are the result of the locality in which it is played.
This is a sturdy game, and a manly, but singularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
inappropriately termed football. The ball indeed
and the feet are both present; but the ball is of
microscopic size, the number of the players is considerable,
and the limits of the ground are exceedingly
narrow. Such is the compactness of the
mass of players and the hardness of the wall
alongside which the game takes place, that the ball
is encased in a double covering, lest it should be
burst; and the players are enveloped in a kind of
armour of proof. If it were not for this precaution,
minor excrescences, such as ears and the like,
would be rubbed off as completely as jagged
knobs are removed from a stick by sandpaper and
spoke-shave; skin, too, would, at the end of the
game, be conspicuous by its absence from the
players nearest the wall.</p>

<p>Into the niceties of this game it is not proposed
to enter; for though an excellent pastime, it cannot
be described as football, and is simply a question
of shoving. There used, however, to exist at
Winchester College a practice not dissimilar. On
Saturday evenings in the Christmas term, commonly
called “short-half,” it was customary for the
College boys to assemble in 7th chamber for the
purpose of singing; after the singing was over, the
prefects assembled, eighteen in number, in the
doorway, which was exceeding cramped; opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
them the juniors, fifty-two in number, ranged themselves,
and what was called a “down-hot” took
place. Juniors tried to force their way out, the
prefects tried to keep them in, and there was no
mercy for him who fell. With the single exception
that in a “down-hot” the formality of “delivering
a ball in the midst,” as Strutt has it, was dispensed
with, there were many features of similarity
between it and the wall game. Lovers of football
might well wish that, as in life they were similar, so
in death they might not be divided. The “down-hot,”
together with the College singing, has long
gone the way of all flesh, and has been swept into
the dustbin of the past by the broom of the
reformer. It were a matter not much to be
regretted that the wall game should also perish.</p>

<p>The Eton field game, on the other hand, is a
very fine game of football, and has been found to
be an excellent training-ground for Association.
Both in the forward and backward divisions old
Etonians have been prominent; and nothing but
the fact that personal references are contrary to our
principles prevents an enumeration of well-known
names. The same deference to principle has prevented
the naming of Wykehamists who have been
heroes in international contests, and will prohibit
the mention of the names of the great players of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Harrow, of Westminster, of Rugby, and of Charterhouse.</p>

<p>The distinguishing points of the field game are
pace, and, if the word may be used without offence,
honesty. The ball, as in the wall game, is very
small, being about the size of a toy football such
as one buys for children. It is also exceedingly
light, and will travel at a great pace; the result
is, that from the moment when they begin to play
Eton boys volley without hesitation, and when
they reach man’s estate, can volley the Association
ball incomparably better than the generality of
men trained elsewhere. On the other hand, it is
not, in our opinion, a good ball for men to play
with. The full strength of a muscular leg, scientifically
applied, drives the ball so far that there are
periods at which either the game degenerates into
an interchange of volleys between the backs
(“behinds”), or the ball is occasionally kicked far
beyond the reach of any player.</p>

<p>It now becomes necessary to explain the use of
the word “honesty” a few lines above. There is
no game, except perhaps the Winchester game, in
which the rules of “off-side” are so strict; and to
“corner” or to “sneak,” that is to say, to play
“off-side,” or to hang about with the intention of
so doing, are serious offences thoroughly foreign to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the principle of the game. Perhaps it is not too
much to say, that in proportion to the strictness
with which the off-side rule is formulated and
observed is the normal pace of any game. Certain
it is, that of all games the Winchester, Eton, and
Rugby games are the fastest, and that in them the
off-side rule is most stringent. The “bully” with
which the Eton game begins, is very like a
“scrimmage” or a “hot”; but there is this
essential difference between the Eton game and
the Winchester, that it permits and encourages
dribbling; it differs from all games except the
Association game in prohibiting the use of the
hands; and from the Association game in
particular, in the prohibition of forward passing.
It should be mentioned that goals are not
frequently obtained at this game, for the goal
posts are both narrow and low; but there are
minor points, called “rouges,” which may be
obtained, and which may score the victory.</p>

<p>A rouge is an intricate business; and it must be
prefaced that the subjoined account is not written
by an Etonian, who alone is familiar with the
almost Eleusinian mystery, but is merely the result
of something like a dozen experiences of the
pleasant Eton game which used to be played in
the Merton College cricket ground at Oxford.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
The proceedings appeared to be these:—One side,
which may be called A, having succeeded in driving
the ball into the neighbourhood of the line
running through B’s goal from side to side of the
ground, proceeded slowly to urge the ball along
the line in the direction of the goal. In this performance
they were carefully watched by their
opponents, who did not interfere to prevent them
unless one of the side A happened to lose command
of the ball for a moment, for, if the ball was
driven behind the line after last touching one of
the side B, a rouge was scored to the credit of A.
A rouge, besides being a point in itself, was
capable of being turned into a goal; for when the
ball had been driven behind, a peculiar and exceedingly
compact scrimmage was formed close to
the goal itself; one of the defending party holding
the ball between his knees and sitting on the
knee of a person behind him, who himself placed
his foot upon the ball. These two principal
defenders were themselves backed up by subordinates
behind; and approach to them was rendered
difficult by the arranging of a double line of
players. Up the lane thus formed the opposing
party, headed by their strongest and heaviest man,
charged in column, at a heavy trot, and a tremendous
struggle ensued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>The accuracy of this account of a rouge is not
vouched for; but it has at least this merit, that it
is a faithful representation of the impression produced
upon the mind of one not nurtured at
Eton, by a few experiences of a most pleasant
game.</p>

<p>The Harrow game, though nice enough in the
playing, is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red
herring. It is played with a peculiarly awkward-looking
oval ball, over which Harrow boys attain a
complete mastery, but which completely gets the
better of other players. Upon <i>à priori</i> grounds
one would say that it was the most primitive form
of ball, and originally represented nothing but a
bladder with the rudest form of covering that
could be put together out of three pieces of leather.
The features of the game are the punting
and the dribbling, and the fact that the goal has
no limit in the way of height. <i>A solo usque ad
cœlum</i>, in fact, is a maxim more applicable to the
Harrow goal than, as may be seen from a recent
decision in the matter of overhead wires, to territorial
possession. The next most noticeable
characteristic will be suggested immediately by the
words “three yards.” Any player may catch the
ball on the full volley from a kick by one of the
other side, or from a kick by one of his own side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
if, at the time when the kick is made, he is nearer
to his own goal than to that of the adversary.
Having caught it he calls out “Three yards,”
making his mark in the ground with his heel, and
if he does this in time, he is allowed a free kick at
the adversaries’ goal, no one being allowed to come
within the distance named, for the purpose of
interfering with his kick.</p>

<p>There are other games of football practised at
various schools, which, in a work of more pretentious
size, would deserve detailed description, besides
those of Westminster and Charterhouse.
There is, for instance, the Shrewsbury game, noted
for its name of “dowling,” supposed to be connected
with δοῦλος, “a slave,” which carries in
itself the notion of compulsory football. But space
does not permit us to enter into the merits of this
game; and the omission may be justified partly on
the ground that it was a game of a mixed kind,
and partly on the ground that it has now fallen
into disuse, and has given place to the Association
game.</p>

<p>Between the game as played in the cloisters at
the Charterhouse, and that played on “Green” at
Westminster School there would not appear to be
any essential similarity. The rules of both games
were absolutely determined by their environment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and the circumstances under which they were
played. In a certain sense, both were similar.
Both were played in a confined space, though, of
course, the space in “Green” was less confined
than that of the cloisters; and from this cause it
follows that both Westminster and Charterhouse
boys developed an astounding capacity for dribbling
through dense masses of boys. Both games
again were played at odd times and in ordinary
clothes; and though both were rough and boisterous
enough in all conscience, they clearly were not
so injurious to clothes as the Rugby game, in
which it was allowed to seize and hurl an opponent.
The worst that can follow from a charge in which
the hands are not employed, is downfall into mud
which a clothes-brush will remove more or less
completely from the injured garment; but from
being collared, there may ensue results in the
shape of torn clothes. Hence it came that the boys
educated at these schools, in the first place, prohibited
“collaring” and all use of the hands and
arms, and, in the second place, became extremely
clever at dribbling and at charging with the
shoulders. While this subject is uppermost, it
may not be amiss to enter very slightly into the
question of roughness. The Rugby game unquestionably
appears far rougher to the spectator than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the Association. But, in fact, it is a very doubtful
matter which is the more dangerous. It must be
remembered that it is not the fall to the ground
which is most perilous to life and limb. Seldom,
indeed, is it that anything more serious than a
collar-bone is broken by a fall to the ground.
From the concussion of two bodies, on the contrary,
ribs and arms are apt to suffer, and in
proportion to the preponderance of kicking is the
danger of broken legs. These are of comparatively
rare occurrence, except as the results of
crossed shins; and the more rational conclusion is,
that the rules from which the Association game
took its origin were originally formulated, or rather
grew naturally, from a regard for clothes rather
than limbs.</p>

<p>In another chapter the formulation of the Association
Rules will be discussed; for the present, it
will be enough to say that they owe their origin
mostly to Westminster and Charterhouse. Indeed,
it is not too much to say of the games of football
at present in vogue, that they are due almost
entirely to the desire of men at the Universities
and elsewhere for a continuance of their old
school exercises, and that their connection with the
ancient games is accidental rather than real, remote
rather than near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Of the history of the other form of the game, in
which running with the ball is encouraged, but
little need be said; for from Rugby School, and
from Rugby School alone, what is now known as
the Rugby Union game is derived.</p>

<p>If the view we have taken in the foregoing
pages be correct, while the running and collaring
game was the original national sport of England,
the dribbling game owes its origin to schools in
which the playgrounds were limited in size, and
where various considerations rendered the rough
horseplay which characterized football in the
ancient times impracticable. In the beginning of
this chapter we have pointed out that the size of
the Close at Rugby rendered it possible for the
boys of that school to play the original game without
fear of being hurled when collared against stone
walls, or iron railings, or upon surfaces of gravel.
Hence we should naturally expect to find, in the
game practised at this school, an absence of any
restriction in the way in which the ball was to be
taken towards the adversaries’ goal, and an equal
absence of any restriction in the means of collaring
or stopping one of the attacking party in his
course, and with no limits to the field of play except
those which necessity demanded. It is the very
style of game which is known to have been in vogue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
at Rugby fifty years ago. We need scarcely refer
to the well-known description of the football match
in “Tom Brown’s Schooldays at Rugby,” as that
description is hardly likely to be unknown to any
of our readers; but if any take the trouble to reperuse
it after reading these pages, they can scarcely
fail to notice how little the Rugby game described
there differs from a Rugby Union “Big-side” at the
present day. Indeed, until within the last few
years the Rugby School game suffered no alteration;
but lately the tripping, hacking, and indiscriminate
charging have been abandoned, no doubt more in
respect to the feelings of the numerous fifteens
who visit the school to play matches, than from
any assumed effeminacy of the hard-shinned Rugbeians.
At the present day we believe the Rugby
School fifteens, at any rate in their foreign matches,
conform to the Rugby Union Code.</p>

<p>No doubt there were many other schools at which
a game which allowed running with the ball was
practised; but at no other public school than
Rugby, as far as we are aware, did the collaring,
hacking, and tripping game take root. We can
hardly help thinking, when we recollect with what
rapturous delight football was regarded at Rugby,
that the real cause which kept Rugby football in
the background in other schools, was the sublunary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
consideration of clothes. In ancient times a suit
of clothes was an expensive item of expenditure for
a young gentleman, while the beef and mutton
that he ate cost but a few pence the pound; and
so in every sport the question of how the clothes
would stand it had to be considered. Had Carlyle
been still alive, we might have provided him with
materials for another chapter of <i>Sartor Resartus</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CONCLUSION.<br>

<small><i>The Modern Revival of Football.</i></small></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_067_dca.jpg" width="80" height="75" alt="A">
</div>
<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span> VERY useful rule forbids an historian to
deal with the matters of his own day;
and in obedience to this rule we have
decided not to discuss the developments, changes,
and general progress of modern football since the
institution of the governing bodies of the two
games—Association and Rugby Union—placed
each of them upon a firm basis as a national
sport. The only task, therefore, left to us before
we conclude our welcome labours, is to sketch in
outline the steps which led to the re-establishment
of football in its old position as the chief of the
winter sports of England.</p>

<p>Between thirty and forty years ago began the
first movement in England of the great athletic
revival, which, after gradually spreading until it
covered the whole of the United Kingdom, is
still rolling like a wave over the colonies and all
foreign countries where the English tongue is
spoken. It will not be too much for us to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
that the great athletic movement, which is still
too near for us to be able to calculate its full
effects with certainty, has worked a greater
revolution in English character and habits than
any movement, religious or secular, which has
passed over the country since the time of the
Puritans. Of that great athletic movement the
history has yet to be written; but it would hardly
be wise to attempt to touch it in the present work.
Suffice it to say, that the physical causes of the
desire for hard exercise which has seized upon
men are apparent enough. In modern times,
when nearly all the world is given up to the
feverish bustle and worry of money-making, the
body of a young and lusty man, by a natural
reaction, craves for a muscular exercise, which
may give a relief to the nerves and the brain.
For the performance of this function it is
admitted that there is no game in the world like
football. The student at the University, and
the young man who is tied to his office-stool
throughout all the daylight hours of the winter
months, with the solitary boon of a Saturday’s
half-holiday, alike find that an hour’s hustle at
football sends them home, more tired perhaps,
but happier, calmer, and wiser men.</p>

<p>It is no doubt in some sense owing to the promptings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of this feeling that we find, about thirty years
ago, football-playing being revived fitfully at the
Universities, and matches beginning to be played
between teams of men in London and the
provinces, and with still greater frequency as
years went by. In 1857 the Sheffield Club
(Association) was founded, and in 1858 the great
metropolitan Rugby Union Club, Blackheath, was
established, chiefly by some old pupils of Blackheath
School. About 1861 or 1862 a large
number of clubs playing the dribbling game
sprang up in the neighbourhood of Sheffield, which
has since remained a most flourishing local centre
for that game; while in London two of the first clubs
who started the dribbling game were the Crystal
Palace, in 1861, and the Barnes Club, in 1862.
Indeed, at this time the number and organization
of the dribbling clubs, both in London and the
provinces, was superior to those of the advocates
of the running and tackling game. As far as we
are aware, the Blackheath Club was the only regularly
organized club in the metropolis until the
great rival club at Richmond came into existence,
in 1862. It is in 1863 that the history of football
organization really commences. In the autumn of
that year a conference met for the purpose of attempting
to reduce to a uniform code the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
conflicting rules which were adopted by the
different clubs. It was the intention of the
promoters of the meeting to unite all those
who played football under any rules into a
united body; and the rules agreed upon at the
first meeting were a fair and liberal attempt to
bring about what can hardly be considered anything
but an impossible task, viz., a fusion of
Rugby Union and Association rules. Indeed,
the original rules, framed by the promoters of the
parent Association, included running with the ball
under certain restrictions, as well as hacking and
tripping. In the meantime, however, another conference
of members of the public schools had been
arranging rules at Cambridge, where the dribbling
game had been played on Parker’s Piece as early
as 1855. Eventually, a meeting was arranged
between delegates of the Cambridge and London
conferences; and between them a set of rules was
agreed to which excluded all running with the
ball, and all tackling, hacking, or tripping. Thus
started in 1863 the Football Association; and, save
that in 1867 the strict off-side rule, which was at
first insisted upon, was expunged for the present
modified rule, which gives rise to so many disputes,
there have been few substantial alterations
in the rules up to the present day, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
many changes in the manner of playing. After
this alteration the players from Westminster and
Charterhouse Schools joined the Association
ranks; and in 1870 the sixteen clubs which formed
the Sheffield Association abandoned their own
rules in favour of those of the Association, which
has from that day exercised paramount authority
over all the dribbling clubs of the kingdom. At
the present moment the popularity of the Association
game, especially in the provinces, is
enormous; and if the old governing body can
stand firm amidst the troubles which are arising
at the present day upon the vexed question of
professionalism, its career of prosperity should be
a long one.</p>

<p>To return, however, to the history of the running
and tackling form of the sport—the “Rugby
game,” as it was called even in 1862. When the
Association code forbade running with the ball,
the Blackheath and Richmond Clubs, and the few
other less important and scarcely permanent teams
who played the running rules, naturally held aloof
from the Associated clubs. In the meantime the
number of permanent clubs who played Rugby
rules began to multiply greatly. In 1863 the Civil
Service Club, under these rules, was formed, and
about the same time the Harlequins. In 1865<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Ravenscourt Park was founded; in 1866 the
Flamingoes in London, and several provincial
clubs, including Liverpool; and between this time
and 1870 the clubs playing the older game sprang
up in large numbers all over the kingdom. Although
there was a general similarity in all the
rules played by the various clubs who admitted
running and tackling into their game, the difficulty
of arranging little disputes and differences of
practice used to be very great, as all old players
who had their day before the foundation of the
Rugby Union in 1871 can testify. Disputes of
any consequence were avoided by the universal
adoption of the rule that every club played its own
rules in home matches. It was evident, however,
that a system like this could not last amidst the
rapid spread of the game through the country,
and in the autumn of 1870 negotiations commenced
between members of the Blackheath and
Richmond Clubs, which ended, in January, 1871,
in the foundation of the Rugby Union. It is
pleasing to note that the two governing bodies of
football have never come into collision since their
respective foundations. We venture to express a
hope that the footballers of either game will ever
continue to look upon skill in the other and rival
game with admiration, and not with envy.</p>
